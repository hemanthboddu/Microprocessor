Library MyLib is built using files
	MyPackage.vhd
	TwoBitAdder.vhd

Library work contains stuff from
	Testbench.vhd


The shell script compile_ghdl.sh 
first includes stuff that will be in library MyLib
	ghdl -i --work=MyLib  MyPackage.vhd
	ghdl -i --work=MyLib  TwoBitAdder.vhd

then the library work:
	ghdl -i --work=work Testbench.vhd

finally makes the testbench from library work.
	ghdl -m Testbench
