	compile_ghdl.sh
		script to compile VHDL files
		type
                  source compile_ghdl.sh
		to produce executable named testbench

		To simulate for 100 ns, 
                 ./testbench --stop-time=100ns --vcd=run.vcd
                This generates a waveform file run.vcd, and
		reports success/failure of the tests.  An output
		file OUTPUTS.txt to flag errors is also created.

	FSM.vhd
		VHDL description of FSM, and a testbench.

	README
		this file.
	
	TRACEFILE.txt
		pattern-file used by the testbench.  This contains
		input-waveform and expected output waveform.  The
		input-symbols are coded with 2 bits as 
			a <-> 00
			b <-> 01
		The output symbols are coded with 1 bit as
			Q <-> 0
			P <-> 1

		The TRACEFILE specifies the signal values at
		the input for each clock-event.

		clk input-symbol    expected-output-symbol
				     checked after input-application.
